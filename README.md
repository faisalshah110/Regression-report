This repository contains three key documents related to research and analysis in the fields of cognitive performance, telehealth services, and episodic memory. Below is a brief overview of each document.

1. The Effects of Time and tDCS Stimulation on Cognitive Performance

	•	File Name: Anovaa.docx
	•	Description:
This document presents a study that examines the impact of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and timing on cognitive performance. Using a between-subjects experimental design, the study involved 70 participants divided into active and sham stimulation groups. Key findings highlight the potential of tDCS to enhance cognitive abilities, particularly when measurements are taken at appropriate times.
	•	Key Sections: Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, References.
	•	Highlights: Statistical analysis includes ANOVA tests with significant results supporting the hypothesis that anodal tDCS improves cognitive performance.

2. Understanding Patient Experiences in Telehealth Services

	•	File Name: Qualitative Report.docx
	•	Description:
This qualitative research explores patient satisfaction and challenges with telehealth services. Grounded theory methodology was applied to analyze data from 10 participants who shared their experiences. The study identifies both advantages (e.g., accessibility) and drawbacks (e.g., communication issues, lack of personal interaction).
	•	Key Sections: Abstract, Introduction, Methodology, Results, Discussion, Limitations, Conclusion, References.
	•	Highlights: Suggestions for enhancing telehealth include improved communication training for healthcare providers and user-friendly platform designs.

3. The Impact of Cognitive Reserve on Episodic Memory Recall Post-tDCS

	•	File Name: regression.docx
	•	Description:
This document focuses on the role of cognitive reserve and neuropsychological predictors in episodic memory recall following tDCS. The study involves a sample of 100 healthy adults, measuring cognitive reserve through standardized tests. Results indicate that higher cognitive reserve predicts better memory performance post-tDCS, supporting the cognitive reserve hypothesis.
	•	Key Sections: Abstract, Introduction, Method, Results, Discussion, References.
	•	Highlights: Includes multiple regression analysis demonstrating that cognitive reserve and neuropsychological performance accounted for 78.3% of the variance in memory recall.

Repository Purpose

The files in this repository aim to contribute to research and understanding in cognitive enhancement, telehealth, and neuropsychology. Each document provides detailed methodologies, results, and recommendations for future studies
